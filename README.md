Installation Instructions:

Prerequisites:
1. Install Node and NPM
2. Install Grunt

Then: 
1. Clone Repository
2. cd into local directory
3. run "npm install"

You can start the server with
    
    node app.js
    
Or with

    grunt

which uses nodemon so you don't have to restart the server when you change it 
(though that in particular is not yet working properly).
